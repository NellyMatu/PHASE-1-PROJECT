# PHASE-1 FIRST PROJECT

## AUTHOR : NELLY MATU

## DATE : 18TH JULY 2024

## LEARNING GOALS
- Implement a 'mini' web application using JavaScript.


## PROJECT SETUP
Once you have the plan in place for the application you want to build take the following steps:

- Create a new project folder.
- Create a new GitHub repository (NB: ENSURE IT IS PRIVATE).
- Add your TM as a contributor to the project. (This is only for grading purposes. We promise we won't steal your code)
- Make sure you regularly commit to the repository.

## PROJECT REQUIREMENTS
1.Your app must be a HTML/CSS/JS frontend that accesses data from a public API or from a db.json file using json-server. Your API or db.json should return a collection of at least 5 objects with each object having at least 3 attributes. All interactions between the client and the API should be handled asynchronously and use JSON as the communication format. Try to avoid using an API that requires a key. APIs that are free and require no authorization will be easiest to use. For ideas, see this list of no-auth APIsLinks to an external site.. If you would like to use an API that requires a key, please consult with your instructor on how to protect that key. NEVER push your API key to github!

2.Your entire app must run on a single page. There should be NO redirects or reloads. In other words, your project will contain a single HTML file.

3.Use at least 3 distinct event listenersLinks to an external site. (3 events of different types) that enable interactivity. What this means is that, if you had 3 click events, that would only count as 1 distinct event and you would need to add at least 2 more. Think search or filter functionality, toggling dark/light mode, upvoting posts, etc. Each of your event listeners should also have its own unique callback function. These must be added using JavaScript's .addEventListener() method. Events embedded into HTML elements and CSS will not count toward the total. Please ask your instructor if you have questions regarding this requirement.

4.Your project must implement at least one instance of array iteration using available array methods (map, forEach, filter, etc). Manipulating your API data in some way should present an opportunity to implement your array iteration.

5.Follow good coding practices. Keep your code DRY (Do not repeat yourself) by utilizing functions to abstract repetitive code.

## Stretch Goals
1.Use json-serverLinks to an external site. in your project to persist your app's interactivity.

## Strategy, Timeline, and Tips
### Planning
Plan out your features
Develop user stories
“As [ a user ], I want [ to perform this action ] so that [ I can accomplish this goal ].”
Features should not need you there to explain them to users
Plan out the structure of your JSON requests

### Project Pitches
Before you start working on your project, you'll pitch your project idea to your instructors for approval and feedback.

For your project pitch, you should include:

  -The basic story of your application
  -The core features of your MVP
 -The API data you'll be using and how you'll use it
 -Challenges you expect to face
 -How you are meeting the requirements of the project

 ### MVP ASAP
 -Build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) as quickly as possible.
 -Pick an API and explore it early on to ensure it will work for your need.

 ### Guidelines for Staying Organized
  -Write down the decisions you make about your project. This will not only help you think more clearly, it will also help you communicate your project to instructors when asking for help. In addition to writing everything down, we also recommend the following to help stay organized and on track:

 -Describe/sketch your ideas (use diagrams!).
 -Start by creating a frontend directory with the basic files you'll need
 -Next, build enough code to get some API data to work with. Don't worry about building all of your async code yet, just get to the point where you can access one endpoint on an API, then start working on getting that data displayed.
 -Then, continue to build additional async code and frontend features.
 -Continue building features one by one.
 -Check in with your instructors to make sure your scope and timeline are manageable.

 
## Clothing Store Web App
 -This is a simple clothing store web application that fetches product data from a local JSON server and displays it on the web page. Users can view product details and update the stock when they click the "Buy Now" button.


### Getting Started
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

 - Clone this repository to your local machine.
 - Ensure you have Node.js installed.
 - Install dependencies using npm install.
 - Start the JSON server by running npm run server.
 - Open index.html in your browser to view the application.

#### Project Structure
The project structure is as follows:

 - index.html: Main HTML file for the application.
 - style.css: CSS file for styling the application.
 - script.js: JavaScript file containing the logic for fetching data.
 - db.json: JSON file serving as the database with movie data.

### System Requirements
 - Node 18+
 - A browser capable for running JavaScript (Chrome, Firefox, Safari or Edge)
 - Operating System(Windows 10+, MacOS, Linus, etc.)
 - A text editor capable of running JavaScript(Vs Code, Vim, Nano, - - Emacs, Atom, Subline Text, ect.)
 - RAM >= 4GB
 - Disk space >= 1GB

## INSTALLATION
 - To use this follow these steps:

### Alternative One
1.Open your terminal/cli on your computer. 

2.Clone the repository by running the following command:

 git clone git@github.com:NellyMatu/PHASE-1-PROJECT.git

3.Change directory to the repo folder

    cd PHASE-1-PROJECT
4.Open it in your Code Editor of choice. If you use VS Code, run the command:

    code .

### Alternative Two
1.On the top right corner of this page there is a button labelled Fork.

2.Click on that button to create a copy of the repository to your own account.

3.Follow the process described in Alternative One above.

4.Remember to replace your username when cloning.

    git clone https://github.com/NellyMatu/PHASE-1-PROJECT.git

### Getting the files
*fork the repo Create a new branch in your terminal Install the prerequisite. Make appropriate changes in files. Run the server to see the changes Add the changes and commit them Push to the branch Create a pull request

Open the folder location on the terminal and use the following command to run the app:

### HOW TO RUN ALL CODES
clone the repository run using live server

### DEPENDENCIES
practice js, HTML, CSS ,JSON Server

### TECHNOLOGIES USED
HTML/CSS: This is the structure and styling.
JavaScript: It is a language used for adding, marking, and clearing items dynamically.
JSON Server
